      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        India is one of the world's 12 megadiverse countries. It has 45,000 plant species and twice as many animal species. India's animal diversity includes: <br>
        8,61,696 insects, 21,723 fish, 240 amphibians, 460 reptiles, 1,232 birds, 397 mammals.

        India has 33% of its plants that are endemic, meaning they are found nowhere else in the world. 12.6% of mammals, 4.5% of birds, 45.8% of reptiles, and 55.8% of amphibians are also endemic.

      <h2>India's biodiversity has declined due to a number of factors, including:</h2>
      <details open>
        <summary>Habitat loss and fragmentation</summary>
        <p>Deforestation, urbanization, and infrastructure development have destroyed natural habitats, making it difficult for wildlife to survive.</p>
      </details>

      <details open>
        <summary>Poaching</summary>
        <p>Poaching of tigers, rhinos, and the sale of Star tortoises are major wildlife crimes in India. Tigers are an endangered species, poached for their skin and bones to cater to an illegal market.</p>
      </details>

      <details open>
        <summary>Killing for precious commodities</summary>
        <p>Killing for ivory and trapping of birds and mammals as collector's items, curiosities, and for rearing as pets has threatened other species.</p>
      </details>

      <details open>
        <summary>Over-exploitation of forests</summary>
        <p>The over-exploitation of forests has raised the problem of bird life.
            Other factors that have led to the decline in India's biodiversity include: Hunting, Environmental pollution, Poisoning, Forest fires.</p>

      <h2>Steps Taken By Government for Biodiversity Protection</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The Central Government has enacted <strong>the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972</strong>. The Act, inter alia, provides for the creation of Protected Areas for the protection of wildlife and also provides for punishment for hunting of specified fauna specified in the schedules I to IV thereof.</li> <br>
        <li> <strong>Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules 2010</strong>  have been framed for the <em>protection of wetlands,</em>  in the States.</li> <br>
        <li>The Centrally Sponsored Scheme of <strong>National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-System</strong>  also provides assistance to the States for the management of wetlands including Ramsar sites in the country.</li> <br>
        <li> <strong>Wildlife Crime Control Bureau</strong> has been established for control of illegal trade in wildlife, including endangered species.</li> <br>
        <li>The Centrally Sponsored Scheme <strong>Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats</strong> has been modified by including a new component namely <strong>Recovery of Endangered Species</strong> and 16 species have been identified for recovery viz.</li>
